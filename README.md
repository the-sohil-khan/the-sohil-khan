## Hi there, I’m so glad you’re here!

## 👋 Hey there, I'm Sohil Khan!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 👋
This is where curiosity meets code, and learning never stops. I’m passionate about growing in my career, picking up new skills, and making complex work feel a little more manageable—and a lot more rewarding.

Here’s what lives here:

🛠️ Projects shaped by hands-on learning and real-world problem solving

📚 Lessons learned while balancing work, deadlines, and the occasional bug

🌱 A bit of inspiration for anyone striving to survive—and thrive—in the corporate jungle


Whether you’re here for practical code, a bit of inspiration, or just to see how someone else is figuring things out—welcome!

Let’s learn, build, and grow together, one repo at a time.
You bring the ideas, I’ll bring the code ☕💻
